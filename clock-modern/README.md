# Clock Modern Way

Simple static page that creates concentric rings (dates, months, weekdays) surrounding an analog clock.

How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).

Files

- `index.html` — markup
- `styles.css` — styles for rings + analog clock
- `script.js` — generates ring items and updates clock every second

Notes

- The script positions labels around circles and highlights the current date/month/day.
